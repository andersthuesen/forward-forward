# Hinton's Forward-Forward algorithm

## My focus areas

This is my implementation of Hinton's forward-forward algorithm for training neural networks. I've primarily focused on the recurrent structure presented in the GLOM paper, since I find it the most probable.

## Todo

- Implement local goodness scores

## Questions

- How would the brain know how to reverse the gradient direction in sleep?
